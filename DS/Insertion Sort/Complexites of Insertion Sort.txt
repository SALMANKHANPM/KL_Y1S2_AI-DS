The time and space complexities of Insertion Sort are as follows:

Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(n) - when the input array is already sorted.
Worst Case: O(n^2) - when the input array is sorted in reverse order.
Average Case: O(n^2)
Space Complexity:

The space complexity of Insertion Sort is O(1), as it requires a constant amount of additional space to perform the sorting operation.

It is important to note that Insertion Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, which means it modifies the original array without requiring additional memory for a new copy of the array.
