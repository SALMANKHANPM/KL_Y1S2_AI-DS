Let's apply this approach to the given sequence of records:

Step 1: Divide the input data into smaller chunks

We can divide the input data into two chunks of size 5:

Chunk 1: 17, 3, 29, 56, 24
Chunk 2: 18, 4, 9, 10, 23

Step 2: Sort each chunk

We can use an efficient in-memory sorting algorithm like quicksort to sort each chunk:

Chunk 1: 3, 17, 24, 29, 56
Chunk 2: 4, 9, 10, 18, 23

Step 3: Write each sorted chunk to a temporary file

We can write each sorted chunk to a temporary file on the disk:

File 1: 3, 17, 24, 29, 56
File 2: 4, 9, 10, 18, 23

Step 4: Merge the temporary files into a single sorted file

We can use a 2-way merge sort algorithm to merge the two temporary files into a single sorted file:

Merged file: 3, 4, 9, 10, 17, 18, 23, 24, 29, 56

Therefore, the sequence of records sorted in ascending order using external sorting (2-way merge sort) is: 3, 4, 9, 10, 17, 18, 23, 24, 29, 56.
