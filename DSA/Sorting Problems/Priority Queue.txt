A priority queue is a type of queue that arranges elements based on the priority values. Elements with higher priority values are typically retrived before elements with lower priority values .

In a priority queue each element has a priority value associated with it. When you add a element to the queue, it is inserted in a position based on it's priority value.

Example : if you add an element with a high priority value to a priority queue, it may be inserted near the front of the queue, while an element with a low priority value may be inserted near the back of the queue.


Properties of Priority :
- Every item has a priority associated with it.
- An element with high priority is dequeued before an element with low priority.
- If the two elements have the same priority,they are served according to their order[index] in the queue.


Example : Queue = | 2 | 6 | 7 | 10 | 11 |
		
	This is Ascending Order Priority Queue
	Here, 2 has the highest Priority
		11 has the lowe
