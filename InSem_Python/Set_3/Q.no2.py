"""
    
A tuple is a collection of immutable objects. Tuples are ordered, so the order of the elements is preserved. Tuples are also immutable, meaning that once they are" created, they cannot be modified.

count(): The count() method returns the number of occurrences of an element in a tuple.

Example:

tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5)
print(tuple1.count(3))

Output: 3

index(): The index() method returns the index of the specified element in the tuple.

Example:

tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5)
print(tuple1.index(3))

Output: 2

Membership operators: The in and not in operators can be used to test if an element is present in a tuple.

Example:

tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)

print(1 in tuple1)

Output: True
