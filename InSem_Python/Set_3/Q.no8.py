""" 
1. issuperset(): This set function takes another set as an argument and returns true if the calling set is a superset of the argument set (i.e. if all the elements of the argument set are contained in the calling set). 
2. issubset(): This set function takes another set as an argument and returns true if the calling set is a subset of the argument set (i.e. if all the elements of the calling set are contained in the argument set).
3. union(): This set function takes another set as an argument and returns a new set that contains all the elements of both sets (i.e. the union of the two sets).
4. symmetricdifference(): This set function takes another set as an argument and returns a new set that contains all the elements that are in either one set or the other set but not in both sets (i.e. the symmetric difference of the two sets).
